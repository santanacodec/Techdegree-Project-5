# Techdegree-Project-5
 The fifth Techdegree project for Treehouse

 In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. 
 Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions. 
 At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. 
 When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. 
 There should be a back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.
